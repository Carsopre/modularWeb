# modularWeb

Django (Python), HTML, CSS Bootstrap.

A simple web App that allows anyone to create their own web page, either for commercial or personal use. 

This modular web started as a plain HTML that later was integrated into a Django framework for further development and reusuability. Down the road, this APP will allow the user to edit the entire web without touching a single line of code. Additionally, other plugins will be created on the very basis of the APP to compliment it, such as ERP, CRM, Shopping tools, etc. Along the development, look and feel issues will be tackled as well as functionality improvements.
